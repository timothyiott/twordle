This application is a replica of the wordle application. I made some modifications to it. The end goal of the game is to find the word that is assigned as the solution of the puzzle. The game is played by entering in a guess word. The tiles will show up green if the letter is in the solution and in the right position within the word. The tile will show up yellow if the letter is not in the right position but it is in the solution word.
